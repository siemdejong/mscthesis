  abstract    = {Restart techniques are common in gradient-free optimization to deal with multimodal functions. Partial warm restarts are also gaining popularity in gradient-based optimization to improve the rate of convergence in accelerated gradient schemes to deal with ill-conditioned functions. In this paper, we propose a simple warm restart technique for stochastic gradient descent to improve its anytime performance when training deep neural networks. We empirically study its performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, where we demonstrate new state-of-the-art results at 3.14\% and 16.21\%, respectively. We also demonstrate its advantages on a dataset of EEG recordings and on a downsampled version of the ImageNet dataset. Our source code is available at https://github.com/loshchil/SGDR},

  abstract     = {Automated analysis of microscope images is necessitated by the increased need for high-resolution follow up of events in time. Manually finding the right images to be analyzed, or eliminated from data analysis are common day-to-day problems in microscopy research today, and the constantly growing size of image datasets does not help the matter. We propose a simple method and a software tool for sorting images within a dataset, according to their relative quality. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in finding good quality images in a STED microscope sample preparation optimization image dataset. The results are validated by comparisons to subjective opinion scores, as well as five state-of-the-art blind image quality assessment methods. We also show how our method can be applied to eliminate useless out-of-focus images in a High-Content-Screening experiment. We further evaluate the ability of our image quality ranking method to detect out-of-focus images, by extensive simulations, and by comparing its performance against previously published, well-established microscopy autofocus metrics.},

It has been argued that explainable AI will engender trust with the health-care workforce, provide transparency into the AI decision making process, and potentially mitigate various kinds of bias. In this Viewpoint, we argue that this argument represents a false hope for explainable AI and that current explainability methods are unlikely to achieve these goals for patient-level decision support. We provide an overview of current explainability techniques and highlight how various failure cases can cause problems for decision making for individual patients. In the absence of suitable explainability methods, we advocate for rigorous internal and external validation of AI models as a more direct means of achieving the goals often associated with explainability, and we caution against having explainability be a requirement for clinically deployed models.},

We use the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method called Integrated Gradients. Our method requires no modification to the original network and is extremely simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a network, and to enable users to engage with models better.},

  abstract     = {We address the challenging problem of whole slide image (WSI) classification. WSIs have very high resolutions and usually lack localized annotations. WSI classification can be cast as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem when only slide-level labels are available. We propose a MIL-based method for WSI classification and tumor detection that does not require localized annotations. Our method has three major components. First, we introduce a novel MIL aggregator that models the relations of the instances in a dual-stream architecture with trainable distance measurement. Second, since WSIs can produce large or unbalanced bags that hinder the training of MIL models, we propose to use self-supervised contrastive learning to extract good representations for MIL and alleviate the issue of prohibitive memory cost for large bags. Third, we adopt a pyramidal fusion mechanism for multiscale WSI features, and further improve the accuracy of classification and localization. Our model is evaluated on two representative WSI datasets. The classification accuracy of our model compares favorably to fully-supervised methods, with less than \2% accuracy gap across datasets. Our results also outperform all previous MIL-based methods. Additional benchmark results on standard MIL datasets further demonstrate the superior performance of our MIL aggregator on general MIL problems.

Traditional methods rely on regions of interest (ROIs) which require great efforts to annotate. Inspired by the success of using deep convolutional features for natural image analysis and multi-instance learning (MIL) for labeling a set of instances/patches, we propose end-to-end trained deep multi-instance networks for mass classification based on whole mammogram without the aforementioned ROIs. We explore three different schemes to construct deep multi-instance networks for whole mammogram classification. Experimental results on the INbreast dataset demonstrate the robustness of proposed networks compared to previous work using segmentation and detection annotations.

The objective of the neurosurgeon is to maximize tumor removal while preserving healthy brain tissue. However, the lack of a clear tumor boundary hampers the neurosurgeonâs ability to accurately detect and resect infiltrating tumor tissue. Nonlinear multiphoton microscopy, in particular higher harmonic generation, enables label-free imaging of excised brain tissue, revealing histological hallmarks within seconds. Here, we demonstrate a real-time deep learning-based pipeline for automated glioma image analysis, matching video-rate image acquisition. We used a custom noise detection scheme, and a fully-convolutional classification network, to achieve on average 79\% binary accuracy, 0.77 AUC and 0.83 mean average precision compared to the consensus of three pathologists, on a preliminary dataset. We conclude that the combination of real-time imaging and image analysis shows great potential for intraoperative assessment of brain tissue during tumor surgery.</p>},

  abstract     = {<p>The ability to visualize neurons inside living brain tissue is a fundamental requirement in neuroscience and neurosurgery. Especially the development of a noninvasive probe of brain morphology with micrometer-scale resolution is highly desirable, as it would provide a noninvasive approach to optical biopsies in diagnostic medicine. Two-photon laser-scanning microscopy (2PLSM) is a powerful tool in this regard, and has become the standard for minimally invasive high-resolution imaging of living biological samples. However, while 2PLSM-based optical methods provide sufficient resolution, they have been hampered by the requirement for fluorescent dyes to provide image contrast. Here we demonstrate high-contrast imaging of live brain tissue at cellular resolution, without the need for fluorescent probes, using optical third-harmonic generation (THG). We exploit the specific geometry and lipid content of brain tissue at the cellular level to achieve partial phase matching of THG, providing an alternative contrast mechanism to fluorescence. We find that THG brain imaging allows rapid, noninvasive label-free imaging of neurons, white-matter structures, and blood vessels simultaneously. Furthermore, we exploit THG-based imaging to guide micropipettes towards designated neurons inside live tissue. This work is a major step towards label-free microscopic live brain imaging, and opens up possibilities for the development of laser-guided microsurgery techniques in the living brain.</p>},

For example, most popular datasets in computer vision contain images much less than a megapixel in size (0.09MP for ImageNet and 0.001MP for CIFAR-10). In some domains such as medical imaging, multi-megapixel images are needed to identify the presence of disease accurately. We propose a novel method to directly train convolutional neural networks using any input image size end-to-end. This method exploits the locality of most operations in modern convolutional neural networks by performing the forward and backward pass on smaller tiles of the image. In this work, we show a proof of concept using images of up to 66-megapixels (8192Ã8192), saving approximately 50GB of memory per image. Using two public challenge datasets, we demonstrate that CNNs can learn to extract relevant information from these large images and benefit from increasing resolution. We improved the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve from 0.580 (4MP) to 0.706 (66MP) for metastasis detection in breast cancer (CAMELYON17). We also obtained a Spearman correlation metric approaching state-of-the-art performance on the TUPAC16 dataset, from 0.485 (1MP) to 0.570 (16MP).

  eprinttype = {arxiv},
  abstract   = {Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a frequent type of adult nephrotic syndrome, which has a high clinical incidence and can cause various complications. In the biopsy microscope slide of membranous nephropathy, spikelike projections on the glomerular basement membrane is a prominent feature of the MN. However, due to the whole biopsy slide contains large number of glomeruli, and each glomerulus includes many spike lesions, the pathological feature of the spikes is not obvious. It thus is time-consuming for doctors to diagnose glomerulus one by one and is difficult for pathologists with less experience to diagnose. In this paper, we establish a visualized classification model based on the multi-scale annotation multi-instance learning (MSA-MIL) to achieve glomerular classification and spikes visualization. The MSA-MIL model mainly involves three parts. Firstly, U-Net is used to extract the region of the glomeruli to ensure that the features learned by the succeeding algorithm are focused inside the glomeruli itself. Secondly, we use MIL to train an instance-level classifier combined with MSA method to enhance the learning ability of the network by adding a location-level labeled reinforced dataset, thereby obtaining an example-level feature representation with rich semantics. Lastly, the predicted scores of each tile in the image are summarized to obtain glomerular classification and visualization of the classification results of the spikes via the usage of sliding window method. The experimental results confirm that the proposed MSA-MIL model can effectively and accurately classify normal glomeruli and spiked glomerulus and visualize the position of spikes in the glomerulus. Therefore, the proposed model can provide a good foundation for assisting the clinical doctors to diagnose the glomerular membranous nephropathy.},

  abstract   = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are state-of-the-art models for many image classification tasks. However, to recognize cancer subtypes automatically, training a CNN on gigapixel resolution Whole Slide Tissue Images (WSI) is currently computationally impossible. The differentiation of cancer subtypes is based on cellular-level visual features observed on image patch scale. Therefore, we argue that in this situation, training a patch-level classifier on image patches will perform better than or similar to an image-level classifier. The challenge becomes how to intelligently combine patch-level classification results and model the fact that not all patches will be discriminative. We propose to train a decision fusion model to aggregate patch-level predictions given by patch-level CNNs, which to the best of our knowledge has not been shown before. Furthermore, we formulate a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) based method that automatically locates discriminative patches robustly by utilizing the spatial relationships of patches. We apply our method to the classification of glioma and non-small-cell lung carcinoma cases into subtypes. The classification accuracy of our method is similar to the inter-observer agreement between pathologists. Although it is impossible to train CNNs on WSIs, we experimentally demonstrate using a comparable non-cancer dataset of smaller images that a patch-based CNN can outperform an image-based CNN.},

On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

  abstract   = {Multi-instance learning (MIL) is widely used in the computer-aided interpretation of pathological Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to solve the lack of pixel-wise or patch-wise annotations. Often, this approach directly applies "natural image driven" MIL algorithms which overlook the multi-scale (i.e. pyramidal) nature of WSIs. Off-the-shelf MIL algorithms are typically deployed on a single-scale of WSIs (e.g., 20x magnification), while human pathologists usually aggregate the global and local patterns in a multi-scale manner (e.g., by zooming in and out between different magnifications). In this study, we propose a novel cross-scale attention mechanism to explicitly aggregate inter-scale interactions into a single MIL network for Crohn's Disease (CD), which is a form of inflammatory bowel disease. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) a cross-scale attention mechanism is proposed to aggregate features from different resolutions with multi-scale interaction; and (2) differential multi-scale attention visualizations are generated to localize explainable lesion patterns. By training ~250,000 H\&E-stained Ascending Colon (AC) patches from 20 CD patient and 30 healthy control samples at different scales, our approach achieved a superior Area under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.8924 compared with baseline models.

  abstract   = {Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a powerful approach to classify whole slide images (WSIs) for diagnostic pathology. A fundamental challenge of MIL on WSI classification is to discover the \textit{critical instances} that trigger the bag label. However, previous methods are primarily designed under the independent and identical distribution hypothesis (\textit{i.i.d}), ignoring either the correlations between instances or heterogeneity of tumours. In this paper, we propose a novel multiplex-detection-based multiple instance learning (MDMIL) to tackle the issues above. Specifically, MDMIL is constructed by the internal query generation module (IQGM) and the multiplex detection module (MDM) and assisted by the memory-based contrastive loss during training. Firstly, IQGM gives the probability of instances and generates the internal query (IQ) for the subsequent MDM by aggregating highly reliable features after the distribution analysis. Secondly, the multiplex-detection cross-attention (MDCA) and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) in MDM cooperate to generate the final representations for the WSI. In this process, the IQ and trainable variational query (VQ) successfully build up the connections between instances and significantly improve the model's robustness toward heterogeneous tumours. At last, to further enforce constraints in the feature space and stabilize the training process, we adopt a memory-based contrastive loss, which is practicable for WSI classification even with a single sample as input in each iteration. We conduct experiments on three computational pathology datasets, e.g., CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC datasets. The superior accuracy and AUC demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MDMIL over other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract   = {Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces the training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.},

  abstract   = {As the rapid growth of high-speed and deep-tissue imaging in biomedical research, it is urgent to find a robust and effective denoising method to retain morphological features for further texture analysis and segmentation. Conventional denoising filters and models can easily suppress perturbative noises in high contrast images. However, for low photon budget multi-photon images, high detector gain will not only boost signals, but also bring huge background noises. In such stochastic resonance regime of imaging, sub-threshold signals may be detectable with the help of noises. Therefore, a denoising filter that can smartly remove noises without sacrificing the important cellular features such as cell boundaries is highly desired. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network based autoencoder method, Fully Convolutional Deep Denoising Autoencoder (DDAE), to improve the quality of Three-Photon Fluorescence (3PF) and Third Harmonic Generation (THG) microscopy images. The average of the acquired 200 images of a given location served as the low-noise answer for DDAE training. Compared with other widely used denoising methods, our DDAE model shows better signal-to-noise ratio (26.6 and 29.9 for 3PF and THG, respectively), structure similarity (0.86 and 0.87 for 3PF and THG, respectively), and preservation of nuclear or cellular boundaries.},

However, due to constraints in image formation and acquisition, to obtain high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) fluorescence images remains difficult. Strong noise negatively affects not only visual observation but also downstream analysis. To address this problem, we propose a blind global noise modeling denoiser (GNMD) that simulates image noise globally using a generative adversarial network (GAN). No prior information on noise properties is required. And no clean training targets need to be provided for noisy inputs. Instead, by simulating real image noise using a GAN, our method synthesizes paired noisy and clean images for training a denoising deep learning network. Experiments on real fluorescence microscopy images show that our method substantially outperforms competing state-of-the-art methods, especially in suppressing background noise. Denoising using our method also facilitates downstream image segmentation.},

The development of weakly supervised segmentation algorithm alleviates the problem of medical image annotation that it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. As a subset of weakly supervised learning, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been proven to be effective in segmentation. However, there is a lack of related information between instances in MIL, which limits the further improvement of segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised method for pixel-level segmentation in histopathology images, which introduces Transformer into the MIL framework to capture global or long-range dependencies. The multi-head self-attention in the Transformer establishes the relationship between instances, which solves the shortcoming that instances are independent of each other in MIL. In addition, deep supervision is introduced to overcome the limitation of annotations in weakly supervised methods and make the better utilization of hierarchical information. The state-of-the-art results on the colon cancer dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with other weakly supervised methods.

  abstract   = {Whole slide image (WSI) classification often relies on deep weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) methods to handle gigapixel resolution images and slide-level labels. Yet the decent performance of deep learning comes from harnessing massive datasets and diverse samples, urging the need for efficient training pipelines for scaling to large datasets and data augmentation techniques for diversifying samples. However, current MIL-based WSI classification pipelines are memory-expensive and computation-inefficient since they usually assemble tens of thousands of patches as bags for computation. On the other hand, despite their popularity in other tasks, data augmentations are unexplored for WSI MIL frameworks. To address them, we propose ReMix, a general and efficient framework for MIL based WSI classification. It comprises two steps: reduce and mix. First, it reduces the number of instances in WSI bags by substituting instances with instance prototypes, i.e., patch cluster centroids. Then, we propose a ``Mix-the-bag'' augmentation that contains four online, stochastic and flexible latent space augmentations. It brings diverse and reliable class-identity-preserving semantic changes in the latent space while enforcing semantic-perturbation invariance. We evaluate ReMix on two public datasets with two state-of-the-art MIL methods. In our experiments, consistent improvements in precision, accuracy, and recall have been achieved but with orders of magnitude reduced training time and memory consumption, demonstrating ReMix's effectiveness and efficiency.

  abstract     = {Background and Objective: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affecting the colon and the rectum characterized by a remitting-relapsing course. To detect mucosal inflammation associated with UC, histology is considered the most stringent criteria. In turn, histologic remission (HR) correlates with improved clinical outcomes and has been recently recognized as a desirable treatment target. The leading biomarker for assessing histologic remission is the presence or absence of neutrophils. Therefore, the finding of this cell in specific colon structures indicates that the patient has UC activity. However, no previous studies based on deep learning have been developed to identify UC based on neutrophils detection using whole-slide images (WSI). Methods: The methodological core of this work is a novel multiple instance learning (MIL) framework with location constraints able to determine the presence of UC activity using WSI. In particular, we put forward an effective way to introduce constraints about positive instances to effectively explore additional weakly supervised information that is easy to obtain and enjoy a significant boost to the learning process. In addition, we propose a new weighted embedding to enlarge the relevance of the positive instances. Results: Extensive experiments on a multi-center dataset of colon and rectum WSIs, PICASSO-MIL, demonstrate that using the location information we can improve considerably the results at WSI-level. In comparison with prior MIL settings, our method allows for 10\% improvements in bag-level accuracy. Conclusion: Our model, which introduces a new form of constraints, surpass the results achieved from current state-of-the-art methods that focus on the MIL paradigm. Our method can be applied to other histological concerns where the morphological features determining a positive WSI are tiny and similar to others in the image.},

We apply DeepSMILE to the task of Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and microsatellite instability (MSI) prediction. We utilize contrastive self-supervised learning to pre-train a feature extractor on histopathology tiles of cancer tissue. Additionally, we use variability-aware deep multiple instance learning to learn the tile feature aggregation function while modeling tumor heterogeneity. For MSI prediction in a tumor-annotated and color normalized subset of TCGA-CRC (n=360 patients), contrastive self-supervised learning improves the tile supervision baseline from 0.77 to 0.87 AUROC, on par with our proposed DeepSMILE method. On TCGA-BC (n=1041 patients) without any manual annotations, DeepSMILE improves HRD classification performance from 0.77 to 0.81 AUROC compared to tile supervision with either a self-supervised or ImageNet pre-trained feature extractor. Our proposed methods reach the baseline performance using only 40\% of the labeled data on both datasets. These improvements suggest we can use standard self-supervised learning techniques combined with multiple instance learning in the histopathology domain to improve genomic label classification performance with fewer labeled data.},

In applied life sciences, THG delivers a versatile contrast modality to complement multi-parameter fluorescence, second harmonic generation and fluorescence lifetime microscopy, which allows detection of cellular and molecular cell functions in threedimensional tissue culture and small animals. In this Commentary, we review the physical and technical basis of THG, and provide considerations for optimal excitation, detection and interpretation of THG signals.

Most previous work on whole slide image analysis has focused on classification or segmentation of small pre-selected regions-of-interest, which requires fine-grained annotation and is non-trivial to extend for large-scale whole slide analysis. In this paper, we proposed a multi-resolution multiple instance learning model that leverages saliency maps to detect suspicious regions for fine-grained grade prediction. Instead of relying on expensive region- or pixel-level annotations, our model can be trained end-to-end with only slide-level labels. The model is developed on a large-scale prostate biopsy dataset containing 20,229 slides from 830 patients. The model achieved 92.7\% accuracy, 81.8\% Cohen's Kappa for benign, low grade (i.e. Grade group 1) and high grade (i.e. Grade group â¥ 2) prediction, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 98.2\% and an average precision (AP) of 97.4\% for differentiating malignant and benign slides.

  abstract     = {Most oncological cases can be detected by imaging techniques, but diagnosis is based on pathological assessment of tissue samples. In recent years, the pathology field has evolved to a digital era where tissue samples are digitised and evaluated on screen. As a result, digital pathology opened up many research opportunities, allowing the development of more advanced image processing techniques, as well as artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies. Nevertheless, despite colorectal cancer (CRC) being the second deadliest cancer type worldwide, with increasing incidence rates, the application of AI for CRC diagnosis, particularly on whole-slide images (WSI), is still a young field. In this review, we analyse some relevant works published on this particular task and highlight the limitations that hinder the application of these works in clinical practice. We also empirically investigate the feasibility of using weakly annotated datasets to support the development of computer-aided diagnosis systems for CRC from WSI. Our study underscores the need for large datasets in this field and the use of an appropriate learning methodology to gain the most benefit from partially annotated datasets. The CRC WSI dataset used in this study, containing 1,133 colorectal biopsy and polypectomy samples, is available upon reasonable request.},

We evaluated this framework at scale on a dataset of 44,732 whole slide images from 15,187 patients without any form of data curation. Tests on prostate cancer, basal cell carcinoma and breast cancer metastases to axillary lymph nodes resulted in areas under the curve above 0.98 for all cancer types.

Our results show that this system has the ability to train accurate classification models at unprecedented scale, laying the foundation for the deployment of computational decision support systems in clinical practice.

We trained a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based on the EfficientNet-B3 architecture, using transfer learning and weakly-supervised learning, to predict carcinoma in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) using a training dataset of 3,554 WSIs. We obtained highly promising results for differentiating between lung carcinoma and non-neoplastic with high Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) area under the curves (AUCs) on four independent test sets (ROC AUCs of 0.975, 0.974, 0.988, and 0.981, respectively).

We simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5\% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7\% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50. When fine-tuned on only 1\% of the labels, we achieve 85.8\% top-5 accuracy, outperforming AlexNet with 100X fewer labels.},

Prior deep learning models for MSI detection have relied on neural networks pretrained on ImageNet dataset, which does not contain any medical image. In this study, we leverage recent advances in self-supervised learning by training neural networks on histology images from the TCGA dataset using MoCo V2. We show that these networks consistently outperform their counterparts pretrained using ImageNet and obtain state-of-the-art results for MSI detection with AUCs of 0.92 and 0.83 for CRC and gastric tumors, respectively. These models generalize well on an external CRC cohort (0.97 AUC on PAIP) and improve transfer from one organ to another. Finally we show that predictive image regions exhibit meaningful histological patterns, and that the use of MoCo features highlighted more relevant patterns according to an expert pathologist.},

  abstract    = {In this work, we revisit the global average pooling layer proposed in [13], and shed light on how it explicitly enables the convolutional neural network to have remarkable localization ability despite being trained on image-level labels. While this technique was previously proposed as a means for regularizing training, we find that it actually builds a generic localizable deep representation that can be applied to a variety of tasks. Despite the apparent simplicity of global average pooling, we are able to achieve 37.1\% top-5 error for object localization on ILSVRC 2014, which is remarkably close to the 34.2\% top-5 error achieved by a fully supervised CNN approach. We demonstrate that our network is able to localize the discriminative image regions on a variety of tasks despite not being trained for them},

  abstract     = {We propose a technique for producing "visual explanations" for decisions from a large class of CNN-based models, making them more transparent. Our approach - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept, flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Grad-CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers, (2) CNNs used for structured outputs, (3) CNNs used in tasks with multimodal inputs or reinforcement learning, without any architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization and apply it to off-the-shelf image classification, captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into their failure modes, (b) are robust to adversarial images, (c) outperform previous methods on localization, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model and (e) help achieve generalization by identifying dataset bias. For captioning and VQA, we show that even non-attention based models can localize inputs. We devise a way to identify important neurons through Grad-CAM and combine it with neuron names to provide textual explanations for model decisions. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM helps users establish appropriate trust in predictions from models and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a 'stronger' nodel from a 'weaker' one even when both make identical predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/ramprs/grad-cam/, along with a demo at http://gradcam.cloudcv.org, and a video at youtu.be/COjUB9Izk6E.},

  abstract    = {Over the last decade, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have been highly successful in solving complex vision problems. However, these deep models are perceived as "black box" methods considering the lack of understanding of their internal functioning. There has been a significant recent interest in developing explainable deep learning models, and this paper is an effort in this direction. Building on a recently proposed method called Grad-CAM, we propose a generalized method called Grad-CAM++ that can provide better visual explanations of CNN model predictions, in terms of better object localization as well as explaining occurrences of multiple object instances in a single image, when compared to state-of-the-art. We provide a mathematical derivation for the proposed method, which uses a weighted combination of the positive partial derivatives of the last convolutional layer feature maps with respect to a specific class score as weights to generate a visual explanation for the corresponding class label. Our extensive experiments and evaluations, both subjective and objective, on standard datasets showed that Grad-CAM++ provides promising human-interpretable visual explanations for a given CNN architecture across multiple tasks including classification, image caption generation and 3D action recognition; as well as in new settings such as knowledge distillation.},

In this paper, we verify its applicability in the task of remote sensing image classification. The results show Grad-CAM gives contradictory localization of the important regions for some remote sensing images. To solve this problem, we propose a new strategy, bidirectional gradient verification (BiGradV), to rectify the visual explanation produced by Grad-CAM. The BiGradV is based on the fact both positive and negative gradients can be sensitive to class discrimination of remote sensing images. It designs an internal feature map occlusion with confidence drop decision to verifying which directional gradients works for certain class. The verified gradients are then used to gain the correct visual explanation. Experiments on both remote sensing image dataset and general image datasets demonstrate our proposed strategy is effective and generalized. It could provide a good complement to the Grad-CAM based methods.},

  abstract    = {Gaining insight into how deep convolutional neural network models perform image classification and how to explain their outputs have been a concern to computer vision researchers and decision makers. These deep models are often referred to as black box due to low comprehension of their internal workings. As an effort to developing explainable deep learning models, several methods have been proposed such as finding gradients of class output with respect to input image (sensitivity maps), class activation map ({CAM}), and Gradient based Class Activation Maps (Grad-{CAM}). These methods under perform when localizing multiple occurrences of the same class and do not work for all {CNNs}. In addition, Grad-{CAM} does not capture the entire object in completeness when used on single object images, this affect performance on recognition tasks. With the intention to create an enhanced visual explanation in terms of visual sharpness, object localization and explaining multiple occurrences of objects in a single image, we present Smooth Grad-{CAM}++ {\textbackslash}footnote\{Simple demo: http://35.238.22.135:5000/\}, a technique that combines methods from two other recent techniques---{SMOOTHGRAD} and Grad-{CAM}++. Our Smooth Grad-{CAM}++ technique provides the capability of either visualizing a layer, subset of feature maps, or subset of neurons within a feature map at each instance at the inference level (model prediction process). After experimenting with few images, Smooth Grad-{CAM}++ produced more visually sharp maps with better localization of objects in the given input images when compared with other methods.},

This paper makes two contributions: it introduces {SmoothGrad}, a simple method that can help visually sharpen gradient-based sensitivity maps, and it discusses lessons in the visualization of these maps.

In this paper, after analyzing why Grad-{CAM} performs worse than Grad-{CAM}++ for {RS} images classification from the perspective of weight matrix of gradients, we propose an efficient visual explanation approach dubbed median-pooling Grad-{CAM}. It uses median pooling to capture the main trend of gradients and approximates the contributions of feature maps with respect to a specific class. We further propose a new evaluation index, confidence drop \%, to express the degree of drop of classification accuracy when occluding the important regions that are captured by the visual saliency. Experiments on two {RS} image datasets and for two {CNN} models of {VGG} and {ResNet}, show our proposed method offers a good tradeoff between interpretability and efficiency of visual explanation for {CNN}-based models in {RS} image classification. The low time-complexity median-pooling Grad-{CAM} could provide a good complement to the gradient-based visual explanation techniques in practice.},

  abstract     = {A growing number of artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support systems are showing promising performance in preclinical, in silico, evaluation, but few have yet demonstrated real benefit to patient care. Early stage clinical evaluation is important to assess an AI systemâs actual clinical performance at small scale, ensure its safety, evaluate the human factors surrounding its use, and pave the way to further large scale trials. However, the reporting of these early studies remains inadequate. The present statement provides a multistakeholder, consensus-based reporting guideline for the Developmental and Exploratory Clinical Investigations of DEcision support systems driven by Artificial Intelligence (DECIDE-AI). We conducted a two round, modified Delphi process to collect and analyse expert opinion on the reporting of early clinical evaluation of AI systems. Experts were recruited from 20 predefined stakeholder categories. The final composition and wording of the guideline was determined at a virtual consensus meeting. The checklist and the Explanation \& Elaboration (E\&E) sections were refined based on feedback from a qualitative evaluation process. 123 experts participated in the first round of Delphi, 138 in the second, 16 in the consensus meeting, and 16 in the qualitative evaluation. The DECIDE-AI reporting guideline comprises 17 AI specific reporting items (made of 28 subitems) and 10 generic reporting items, with an E\&E paragraph provided for each. Through consultation and consensus with a range of stakeholders, we have developed a guideline comprising key items that should be reported in early stage clinical studies of AI-based decision support systems in healthcare. By providing an actionable checklist of minimal reporting items, the DECIDE-AI guideline will facilitate the appraisal of these studies and replicability of their findings.},

In addition, many systems, such as image classifiers, operate on low-level features rather than high-level concepts. To address these challenges, we introduce Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), which provide an interpretation of a neural net's internal state in terms of human-friendly concepts. The key idea is to view the high-dimensional internal state of a neural net as an aid, not an obstacle. We show how to use CAVs as part of a technique, Testing with CAVs (TCAV), that uses directional derivatives to quantify the degree to which a user-defined concept is important to a classification result--for example, how sensitive a prediction of "zebra" is to the presence of stripes. Using the domain of image classification as a testing ground, we describe how CAVs may be used to explore hypotheses and generate insights for a standard image classification network as well as a medical application.},

However, training multiple deep networks for model averaging is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a method to obtain the seemingly contradictory goal of ensembling multiple neural networks at no additional training cost. We achieve this goal by training a single neural network, converging to several local minima along its optimization path and saving the model parameters. To obtain repeated rapid convergence, we leverage recent work on cyclic learning rate schedules. The resulting technique, which we refer to as Snapshot Ensembling, is simple, yet surprisingly effective. We show in a series of experiments that our approach is compatible with diverse network architectures and learning tasks. It consistently yields lower error rates than state-of-the-art single models at no additional training cost, and compares favorably with traditional network ensembles. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 our DenseNet Snapshot Ensembles obtain error rates of 3.4\% and 17.4\% respectively.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address the issue of data imbalance in learning deep models for visual object tracking. Although it is well known that data distribution plays a crucial role in learning and inference models, considerably less attention has been paid to data imbalance in visual tracking. For the deep regression trackers that directly learn a dense mapping from input images of target objects to soft response maps, we identify their performance is limited by the extremely imbalanced pixel-to-pixel differences when computing regression loss. This prevents existing end-to-end learnable deep regression trackers from performing as well as discriminative correlation filters (DCFs) trackers. For the deep classification trackers that draw positive and negative samples to learn discriminative classifiers, there exists heavy class imbalance due to a limited number of positive samples when compared to the number of negative samples. To balance training data, we propose a novel shrinkage loss to penalize the importance of easy training data mostly coming from the background, which facilitates both deep regression and classification trackers to better distinguish target objects from the background. We extensively validate the proposed shrinkage loss function on six benchmark datasets, including the OTB-2013, OTB-2015, UAV-123, VOT-2016, VOT-2018 and LaSOT. Equipped with our shrinkage loss, the proposed one-stage deep regression tracker achieves favorable results against state-of-the-art methods, especially in comparison with DCFs trackers. Meanwhile, our shrinkage loss generalizes well to deep classification trackers. When replacing the original binary cross entropy loss with our shrinkage loss, three representative baseline trackers achieve large performance gains, even setting new state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract = {Biological collagenous tissues comprised of networks of collagen fibers are suitable for a broad spectrum of medical applications owing to their attractive mechanical properties. In this study, we developed a noninvasive approach to estimate collagenous tissue elastic properties directly from microscopy images using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Glutaraldehyde-treated bovine pericardium (GLBP) tissue, widely used in the fabrication of bioprosthetic heart valves and vascular patches, was chosen to develop a representative application. A Deep Learning model was designed and trained to process second harmonic generation (SHG) images of collagen networks in GLBP tissue samples, and directly predict the tissue elastic mechanical properties. The trained model is capable of identifying the overall tissue stiffness with a classification accuracy of 84\%, and predicting the nonlinear anisotropic stress-strain curves with average regression errors of 0.021 and 0.031. Thus, this study demonstrates the feasibility and great potential of using the Deep Learning approach for fast and noninvasive assessment of collagenous tissue elastic properties from microstructural images.
              Statement of Significance
              In this study, we developed, to our best knowledge, the first Deep Learning-based approach to estimate the elastic properties of collagenous tissues directly from noninvasive second harmonic generation images. The success of this study holds promise for the use of Machine Learning techniques to noninvasively and efficiently estimate the mechanical properties of many structure-based biological materials, and it also enables many potential applications such as serving as a quality control tool to select tissue for the manufacturing of medical devices (e.g. bioprosthetic heart valves).}

  year      = {2015},
  publisher = {JMLR.org},
  abstract  = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},
