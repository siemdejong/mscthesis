\subsection{Model specification}
The models are combination of a SimCLR pretrained feature extractor and a MIL classifier.
For the MIL classifier, DeepMIL, VarMIL, and CCMIL were trained.
Model weights for the feature extractor and classifier per fold can be downloaded from \href{https://github.io/siemdejong/sclicom}{\faIcon{github} siemdejong/sclicom}.
