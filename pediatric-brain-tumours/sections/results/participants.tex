\subsection{Participants}
In total, there were 45 available cases.
Most cases were concerned with pilocytic astrocytoma (17) and medulloblastoma (8).
This amounts to a total of 134 images of which are 26 overview images and 108 close-up images.
These cases were included in the training and testing of the model.
The included images were taken between 26 September 2022 and 13 April 2023.
No participants have received prior treatment and no images of follow-up treatments are included.
