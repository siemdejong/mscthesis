\subsection{Implications}

\subsubsection{Attention weighted images as model explanation}
There is a growing need for AI models in the clinical to be explainable.
Explainability increases confidence in such models.
Although the attention weighted images have few highlighted tiles, they can still be used to assess the prediction quality.

\subsubsection{Attention weighted images might be used for visual guidance}
Intraoperative tumor type diagnosis can change how surgery is performed, \eg, some tumors types require complete removal but have not been recognized as such before surgery.
As the intraoperative HHG images can be of the order of centimeters and the tumor features of the order of micrometers, it is time-expensive for a pathologist to look at the complete image.
Highlighting certain areas for the pathologist to look at first might decrease the time spent on intraoperative diagnosis.

\subsubsection{Prediction may be consulted as validation}
When working with time constraints, such as in an intraoperative setting, human mistakes may occur more frequently.
Moreover, pathology using HHG microscopy is not well-established yet, so pathologists would need to be trained on HHG images~\cite{Spies2023}, and therefore they make more errors in the beginning of using this modality.
If the model is further improved until a desired performance is reached, the prediction may serve as a (non-binding) diagnosis validation.
