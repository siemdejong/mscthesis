\subsection{Outcome}

The model predicts which tumor type is mostly present in the input image within seconds.
% The prediction is assessed using PR-AUC and $F_1$ score, where the threshold is determined by highest informedness.
The tumor type prediction is assessed by consensus of at least two pathologists, based on HE whole-slide images, tumor location, and patient demographics.

The model also outputs an attention map explaining which tiles were important for the prediction.
