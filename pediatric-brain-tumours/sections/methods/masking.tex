\subsection{Masking}\label{subsec:masking}
Three different masking algorithm designed for HE pathology are evaluated against 8 masks manually made from overview images with QuPath~\cite{Bankhead2017}.
The algorithms include FESI, improved FESI, and EntropyMasker.
For EntropyMasker, the local entropy was calculated with a disk with a radius of \qty{5}{px} as structure element.
For every mask, the IoU is calculated and its mean is reported.
