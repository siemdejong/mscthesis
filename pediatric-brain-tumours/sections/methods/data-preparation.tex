\subsection{Data preparation}

The target classification is transformed to unique numbers.

Images are exported from the raw HHG microscope data by \citeauthor{Spies2023} \sidecite{Spies2023}.
Overview images of \qty{1}{mpp} and close-up images of \qty{0.2}{mpp} of histologically interesting areas were made.
To be able to use both images, the overview images were scaled to the same resolution as close-up images using Lanczos interpolation.

Given the size of the images (\qty{200}{MB} and $7700\times7900$ 8-bit RGB pixels on average) and to be able to use MIL, the images are subdivided into non-overlapping tiles of $224 \times 224$.
Tiles overflowing the image are skipped.

Many overview images contain a large empty space without tissue.
Tiles in these regions do not contain any useful information.
Ideally, empty areas are masked such that only informative tiles are included.
For this, multiple algorithms specifically written for H\&E data are evaluated on HHG data (see \cref{subsec:masking}).
The best performing algorithm, EntropyMasker, is chosen to extract the foreground.

Rescaling, tiling and masking has been done with a fork \sidecite{dlupentropymasker} of the Deep Learning Utilities for Pathology project~\sidecite{Teuwen2023} that includes a reimplementation of the EntropyMasker.
