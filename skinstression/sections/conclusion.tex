\section{Conclusion}
The goal of this study was to develop and validate a model that can construct a stress-strain curve corresponding to SHG images of old adult human skin tissue.
The convolutional neural network achieved a mean $R^2$ of \num{-0.36} (\qty{95}{\percent} CI \numrange{-1.66}{1.06}) on the test set.
Occlusion attribution maps hardly give any explanation to the prediction.
Artificially adding and removing collagen seems to respectively increase and decrease the maximum tissue stress, which is expected.
The model may benefit from more training data and must be validated on a test set that more resembles the training set distribution.
Future studies should use nested k-fold cross validation for selecting models and measuring performance.
An updated version of the model might replace mechanical skin stretch measurements.
