\chapter{Discussion}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generalizability because discarding abdomen data.
    \item Not many different people participating (low sample size).
    \item smoking.
    \item data leakage when using LDS.
    \item collagen is viscoelastic and is therefore timedependent.
    \item yeojohnson data leakage
    \item predictor rescaling not done more than LDS.
    \item number of datapoints in curves could be used to weight the importance of a sample
