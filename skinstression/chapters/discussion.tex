\chapter{Discussion}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generalizability because discarding abdomen data.
    \item Not many different people participating (low sample size).
    \item smoking and other skin damaging things humans do to theirselves :|
    \item data leakage when using LDS.
    \item collagen is viscoelastic and is therefore timedependent.
    \item yeojohnson data leakage
    \item predictor rescaling not done more than LDS.
    \item No multivariate LDS, but parameters treated individually.
    \item number of datapoints in curves could be used to weight the importance of a sample
    \item noise exclusion: not only exclude slices from stacks, but also stacks from stacks
    \item discard strain-stress curve outliers (using PCA?)
    \item (random cropping has a higher probability of including pixels in the middle region)
    \item N2V2 might increase performance compared to no noise reduction
    \item no cross validation done. could further improve results.
    \item WHY DEEP LEARNING?
    \item train/val/test diff of 'source of data' fig
